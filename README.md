## Why the Lakehouse
Everyone's talking about data Lakehouses but what is a Lakehouse other than a nice place to go fishing? Why do you need to know about the lakehouse architecture, whats the benefits and is it all just hype?
	
In this session I'll cover what the Data Lakehouse architecture is, where it fits against existing architectures like a data warehouse, and why you should build one. We'll also cover the underlying technology options to arm you with all of the information you need to plan your next data platform.

## Designing Data Architectures that InfoSec will actually approve
Building your data platform in the cloud is easy, but as soon as that dreaded word "security" becomes involved it suddenly becomes incredibly painful. How do you go about integrating it with your existing networking, how do you manage user security, what on earth is a private endpoint? Over the past year, a lot of these tools have evolved and we now have a set of mature patterns we can apply to actually make a modern data platform secure.

In this session I'll guide you from through a secure reference architecture with Data Factory, Databricks, Data Lake, and Azure Synapse, working together as a secure, fully productionised platform. Each has their own idiosyncrasies, but this session will teach you the options available and the pitfalls to avoid.

## Adventures in CICD with Azure Synapse

In this session we'll look at the process, prerequisites, and pitfalls of setting up a continuous deployment pipeline for Azure Synapse. In this demo-heavy session we'll set up a YAML pipeline using Azure DevOps to deploy Azure Synapse workspace resources through a development lifecycle.

## DIY ETL with Azure tools

How do we handle the edge cases, the unique or temporary solutions to get data from emails, file shares, FTP, someone's desktop etc? 
We need DIY ETL when the easy data sources don't exist, and the usual methods won't work.
In this session, we'll take 3 scenarios, solve them and make them reliable, and repeatable, with tools like Power Automate, Azure functions and more.

## Power BI and PowerShell: A match made in heaven

Power BI is the shiny new tech for processing and visualizing data in the Microsoft Data Platform. However, the plumbing in the background does need managing (even if it is cloud-based and supposedly automagic).

In this session we will take a look at how to manage your datasets, security, monitor licensing and more, all through the ultimate administration interface: PowerShell!

You'll leave the session with an overview of the management capabilities of Power BI and couple that knowledge with the awesome power (and automation possibilities) of PowerShell
